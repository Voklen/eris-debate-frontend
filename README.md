A platform to (hopefully) facilitate productive debates

## Building

This project uses Static Site Generation (SSG) with SolidStart. To build run:
```
bun run build
```
This will create the static files for the website in the `dist/` directory, which you can serve through any webserver. Alternatively, to run for development:
```
bun run dev
```
